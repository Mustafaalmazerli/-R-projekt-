## Introduction  
Predicting used car prices is crucial in the automotive industry. This project investigates the application of regression and machine learning models to achieve accurate price forecasts based on car attributes.

## Methodology  
Data was collected and prepared, then different models including multiple linear regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were trained and evaluated. The performance of each model was assessed using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results  
Both linear regression and SVM showed promising results in predicting car prices. The models were able to make reasonable forecasts, with RMSE values indicating good performance.

## Conclusion  
In conclusion, this project highlights the effectiveness of regression and machine learning techniques in predicting used car prices. Further improvements can be made by refining the models and incorporating additional data attributes.

## Appendix  
Includes additional information such as data sources, model code, and references.
